//! editex
//!
//! A Rust implementation of the Editex phonetic similarity algorithm.
//!
//! ## What Editex computes
//!
//! - `edit_distance(a, b)` computes the Editex distance between two strings.
//! - `similarity(a, b)` computes a normalized score in $[0, 1]$:
//!   $$\text{similarity}(a,b) = 1 - \frac{\text{edit\_distance}(a,b)}{\text{max\_distance}(a,b)}$$
//!
//! The edit costs are driven by phonetic groups in the config. Characters in the
//! same group are cheaper to substitute, insert, or delete than characters in
//! different groups.
